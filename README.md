Project
🟢 Neon Pose Mirror Clone
📖 Overview

Neon Pose Mirror Clone is a real-time computer vision project that tracks human body pose from a webcam feed and creates a mirrored skeletal clone with neon glow effects.

The system uses AI-based pose estimation to extract body landmarks and renders both the original pose and its clone with smooth, glowing visuals — all in real time.
